Setting a machine specific 'repositoryPath' override may be considered harmful for
teams that collaborate on the same repository.

NuGet supports a hierarchy of .Config files so that there may be different settings
between the repository folder, the team folder, and the developer's machine.  The
one closest to the repository wins out.  There is a bug with the implementation of
package restore when the 'repositoryPath' setting is overwritten.  One developer may
set their "global packages" folder to be higher up in the directory tree.  If the
package is lost and it needs to be "restored", the HintPath for references in the
project files will change.  After that point, there will be a disconnect between
different developer's machines for the location of a project's dlls.

Until this bug is resolved, I am going to manually set the repositoryPath setting on
all the CB GitHub repos.
